# Data Representation Big Project

This repository contains my submission for the Big Project assessment in Data Representation.

## Project description: 
~~~
Write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming 
RESTful APIs. 
(Andrew Beatty)
~~~ 

## Repository files:

- A Flask server application program named [app.py]().
- the rest to be added here when figure out the layout ( I am currently in a battle with errors) 


### Activate a virtual environment using the following commands on the command line:

- Make a virtual environment with a directory named venv.: <b> python -m venv venv</b>

- Run the virtual envirnoment: <b>.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux </b>

 - See the packages: <b> pip freeze </b>

 - Save them to a file: <b> pip freeze > requirements.txt </b>

 - Load a file of packages: <b> pip install -r requirements.txt </b> 

 - Set the server environmental variable: <b>set FLASK_APP=app</b> on windows or <b> export FLASK_APP=app </b> on Mac. 

 - Run the server: <b> flask run </b>   This will start the application on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Copy the link into your browser. Click the link to access the web interface.

  - To stop the server running: use <b> ctrl + c. </b>
